/*  What is OOP?
    OOP stands for Object-Oriented Programming.

    Procedural programming is about writing procedures or functions that perform operations on the data, 
    while object-oriented programming is about creating objects that contain both data and functions.

    Object-oriented programming has several advantages over procedural programming:

    OOP is faster and easier to execute
    OOP provides a clear structure for the programs
    OOP helps to keep the C++ code DRY "Don't Repeat Yourself", and makes the code easier to maintain, modify and debug
    OOP makes it possible to create full reusable applications with less code and shorter development time .
    OOPs makes development and maintenance easier where as in Procedure-oriented programming language it is not easy to manage if code grows as project size grows.
    OOPs provide data hiding whereas in Procedure-oriented programming language a global data can be accessed from anywhere.
    OOPs provide ability to simulate real-world event much more effectively. We can provide the solution of real word problem if we are using the Object-Oriented Programming language.

    ** OOP main pillars are: (Inheritance, Polymorphism, Abstraction, Encapsulation)

    **Concepts Provide by OOP: (Object, Class, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Abstraction, Encapsulation);

    Object:
    Any entity that has state and behavior is known as an object. For example: chair, pen, table, keyboard, bike etc. It can be physical and logical.

    Class:
    Collection of objects is called class. It is a logical entity.

    Inheritance:
    When one object acquires all the properties and behaviors of parent object i.e. known as inheritance. It provides code reusability. It is used to achieve runtime polymorphism.

    Polymorphism:
    When one task is performed by different ways i.e. known as polymorphism. For example: to convince the customer differently, to draw something e.g. shape or rectangle etc.

    In C++, we use Function overloading and Function overriding to achieve polymorphism.

    Abstraction:
    Hiding internal details and showing functionality is known as abstraction. For example: phone call, we don't know the internal processing.

    In C++, we use abstract class and interface to achieve abstraction.

    Encapsulation:
    Binding (or wrapping) code and data together into a single unit is known as encapsulation. For example: capsule, it is wrapped with different medicines.
