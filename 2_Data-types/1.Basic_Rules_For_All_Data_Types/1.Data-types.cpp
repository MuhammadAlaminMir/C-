/* 
    Data is a set if values of subjects with respect to qualitative or quantitative varables
    Programming is all about data
    In Programming language we usually manipulate data
    CRUD => Create, Read, Update Delete

    WE Can Categorise Data based on 1. Size,  2. Types(number, text etc)

    besed on type c++ gives us the flowing data type:
    integer, float, character

    Data types in C++ are categorized in three groups:
    1. Built-in 2. User defined 3. Derived.

    c++ gives us some Built-in data type:

    integer = short, int , long, long long
    float = float, double, long double
    charahter = char

    User Defined data types: 
    .Struct 
    .Uninon
    .Enum
    . typedef 
    

    Derived Data types:
    .Array
    .Function
    .Pointer
    note: Insallah I will explane them in latter.
