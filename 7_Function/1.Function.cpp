/* A function is a block of organized, reusable code that is used to perform a single, related action. ...
 Different programming languages name them differently, for example, functions, methods, sub-routines, procedures, etc. 
 function helps us to perform' a specific action multiple times from anywhere in our code.
 
 Banefits of functions:
 Function helps us to divide our code into multiple small groups.
 C functions are used to avoid rewriting same logic/code again and again in a program.
There is no limit in calling C functions to make use of same functionality wherever required.
We can call functions any number of times in a program and from any place in a program.
A large C program can easily be tracked when it is divided into functions.
The core concept of C functions are, re-usability, dividing a big task into small pieces to achieve the functionality and to improve understandability of very large C programs.

Function Forgive everything after complite without static variable
