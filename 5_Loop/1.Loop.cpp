    What is Loop?
    -Loop is a statemanet which repeat a given task a given amount of time. Example:
    Printing name aon the screen, counting 1-100, find even Number bitween 1- 100

    Why do we use loop?
    - IN programming we always have some repetitive tasks. To reduce repetitive code we use loop.
    EX: we have a student database and we want them to send a noticel. If we want it to be done 
    manually it will become near to impossible

    Type of loops in C++
        - For loop (follow step)
        - While loop (follow condition)
        - Do while loop (follow condition but execute at least once)
