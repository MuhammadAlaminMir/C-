// There are two types of header files

// 1. System header files: It comes with the compiler. ex:
#include <iostream>

// 2. User defined header files: It is written by the programmer. ex:
#include "1.Start.cpp" // This will produce an error message if 1.Start.cpp
                       // in not present in the current working directory.
