/* 
    A template is a simple and yet very powerful tool in C++. 
    The simple idea is to pass data type as a parameter so that we don’t need to write the same code for different data types.
    For example, a software company may need sort() for different data types. Rather than writing and maintaining the multiple codes, we can write one sort() and pass data type as a parameter.

    C++ adds two new keywords to support templates: ‘template’ and ‘typename’. The second keyword can always be replaced by keyword ‘class’.
    Templates are powerful features of C++ which allows you to write generic programs. In simple terms, you can create a single function or a class to work with different data types using templates.

    Templates are often used in larger codebase for the purpose of code reusability and flexibility of the programs.

    The concept of templates can be used in two different ways:
    * Function Templates
    * Class Templates
