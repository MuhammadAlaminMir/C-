/* 

   Strings are actually one-dimensional array of characters terminated by a null character '\0'.
    Thus a null-terminated string contains the characters that comprise the string followed by a null. 

 ** Difference Between Character:
  * No need to know size beroehand.
  * Performing operations like concatenation & append is easier.
  * Terminated with a special character "\0"
