/* 
    What is Condition
    - Condition are way to implement a logical sitoation
    in Programming. Sometimes we have different situations and 
    based on one situation we have to excute some sort of code 
    rather then other situation.

    Ex. if user logged in our system we want to show their name ,
    Otherwise we want to show a login button

    Conditional Statement is C++ Programming -
        1. If condition
        2. Else condition
        3. Else if Condition
        4. Switch Statement


    I know js . and C++ Programming language condition are same as js .
