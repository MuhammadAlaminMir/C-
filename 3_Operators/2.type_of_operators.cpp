/* 
    There  are mainly three types of operator available-
    -unary
    -binary
    -tarnary

    when we use a operator into something like(var, number etc) that thing call oparend. like:
    a + b -> hare + is operator, a and b is operand

    Unary Operators: Only have one operand.

    Binary Operators: have two operand.
    There are different type of binary operators available
    - Arithematic (+, -, *, /, %)
    - Relational (<, >, >= , <= , ==. !=)
    - Logical (&&, ||, !)
    - Assignment (=, +=, -=, *=, /= , %=)
    - Bitwise  (&, |, ^, <<, >>)

    Ternary Operators: have three operand.
