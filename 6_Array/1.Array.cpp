// In computer science, an array data structure, or simply an array, is a data structure
// consisting of a collaction of elements, each identified by at least one array index or key.
// An is stored such that the position of each element can be computed from its index tuple array stored such that the position
// of each element can be computed from its index tuple by an mathematical formula.
// simply:
// An array is collaction of data where we can store multiple data at a time.
// An Array is a Data Stucture.
