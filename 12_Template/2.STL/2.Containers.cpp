/* 
    A container is a holder object that stores a collection of other objects (its elements). 
    They are implemented as class templates, which allows a great flexibility in the types supported as elements.

    The container manages the storage space for its elements and provides member functions to access them, 
    either directly or through iterators (reference objects with similar properties to pointers).

    We have 3 types of containers:
    1. Sequence containers
        Used to implement data structures that are sequential in nature like arrays(array) and linked list(list).
    2. Associative containers
        Associative containers implement sorted data structures that can be quickly searched (O(log n) complexity).
    3. Derived Containers
