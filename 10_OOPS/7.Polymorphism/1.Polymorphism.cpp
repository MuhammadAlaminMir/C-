/* 
Polymorphism in C++
C++ polymorphism means that a call to a member function will cause a different function to be executed depending on the type of object that invokes the function. 
You have different classes with a function of the same name, and even the same parameters, but with different implementations.

Polymorphism means "many forms", and it occurs when we have many classes that are related to each other by inheritance. Like we specified in the previous chapter;
 Inheritance lets us inherit attributes and methods from another class. Polymorphism uses those methods to perform different tasks.
 
 In C++ we have two types of polymorphism:
1) Compile time Polymorphism – This is also known as static (or early) binding.
    >> Compile time has two types 1.Function Overloading 2. Operator Overloading
2) Runtime Polymorphism – This is also known as dynamic (or late) binding.
    >> Runtime has one type and its called virtual function
